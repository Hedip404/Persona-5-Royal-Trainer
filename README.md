# Persona 5 Royal trainer TUI - for windows
---
This is a terminal version of the external trainer I'm currently working on as a way to better understand how to read and overwrite memory

It's written in plain C and uses Windows API.

## Build

I personally use the zig cc compiler to build the binary :

```
zig cc -s -o .\target\main.exe .\main.c
```
